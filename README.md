# Check out ColourMaze!
ColourMaze is a 2Â½D puzzle platformer maze game.
The player controls a ball and must venture through a maze by changing colour to pass though certain walls. Collect up to 3 stars per level. At least one star is required to unlock the exit to the next maze, but can you get all of them?
Good luck, and enjoy..
